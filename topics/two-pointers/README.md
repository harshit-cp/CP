# 👆👆 Two Pointers

## Overview
Two pointers technique uses two indices to traverse data structures, often reducing O(n²) to O(n).

## Key Concepts
- Left-right pointers (converging)
- Slow-fast pointers
- Same direction pointers

## Common Patterns
1. **Opposite Direction** - Start from both ends, move toward center
2. **Same Direction** - Both start from beginning, different speeds
3. **Sorted Array** - Leverage sorted property for efficient search

## When to Use
- Sorted arrays
- Finding pairs with specific sum/property
- Removing duplicates in-place
- Palindrome checking
- Container with most water type problems

## Problems Solved

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Pattern | Status |

## Quick Tips
- If array is sorted, think two pointers
- For in-place operations, slow-fast pointers work well
- Always handle edge cases (empty array, single element)
