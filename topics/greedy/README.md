# 💚 Greedy

## Overview
Make locally optimal choices at each step hoping to find global optimum.

## Key Concepts
- Greedy choice property
- Optimal substructure
- Proving correctness (exchange argument)

## Common Patterns
1. **Interval Scheduling** - Sort by end time, pick non-overlapping
2. **Fractional Knapsack** - Sort by value/weight ratio
3. **Activity Selection** - Maximum non-overlapping intervals
4. **Huffman Coding** - Build tree greedily
5. **Jump Game** - Track farthest reachable

## When Greedy Works
- Problem has optimal substructure
- Greedy choice leads to optimal solution
- Usually involves sorting

## Problems Solved

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Pattern | Status |

## Quick Tips
- If greedy seems to work, try to prove or find counter-example
- Usually involves sorting by some criteria
- "Minimum number of X to cover Y" often greedy
