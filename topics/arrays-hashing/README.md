# 🔢 Arrays & Hashing

## Overview
Arrays and hash-based data structures form the foundation of most DSA problems.

## Key Concepts
- Array traversal and manipulation
- Two-pass algorithms
- Hash maps for O(1) lookup
- Frequency counting
- Prefix sums

## Common Patterns
1. **Two Sum Pattern** - Use hashmap to find complement
2. **Frequency Counter** - Count occurrences using map
3. **Prefix Sum** - Precompute cumulative sums for range queries
4. **Grouping/Anagrams** - Use sorted string or char count as key

## Problems Solved

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Pattern | Status |
|---|---------|------------|---------|--------|
| | | | | |

## Quick Tips
- When looking for pairs, think hashmap
- For subarray sums, think prefix sum
- For anagrams/permutations, think character frequency
