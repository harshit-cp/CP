# 💼 Interview Tips & Strategies

## Before the Interview

### Preparation
- Review common patterns for the company
- Practice explaining solutions out loud
- Have your development environment ready
- Test audio/video if remote

## During the Interview

### The UMPIRE Method

1. **U - Understand**
   - Read/listen to the problem carefully
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Identify inputs, outputs, constraints
   - Walk through examples

2. **M - Match**
   - Identify the pattern (DP, Graph, etc.)
   - Recall similar problems
   - Consider data structures needed

3. **P - Plan**
   - Explain your approach before coding
   - Discuss time/space complexity
   - Consider edge cases

4. **I - Implement**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Comment complex logic

5. **R - Review**
   - Trace through with an example
   - Check edge cases
   - Look for bugs

6. **E - Evaluate**
   - Discuss complexity
   - Consider optimizations
   - Ask about follow-ups

## Clarifying Questions to Ask

- What's the input size/range?
- Can there be duplicates?
- Is the input sorted?
- How should I handle edge cases (empty, null)?
- What should I return if no solution exists?
- Is there a time/space constraint?

## Common Edge Cases

- Empty input
- Single element
- All same elements
- Already sorted / reverse sorted
- Negative numbers
- Integer overflow
- Null/None values

## Communication Tips

### Good Practices
- Think out loud
- Explain trade-offs
- Admit when stuck, ask for hints
- Be receptive to feedback
- Test your code verbally

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Jumping to code without planning
- Silent thinking for too long
- Ignoring interviewer hints
- Not handling edge cases
- Writing without explaining

## When Stuck

1. Re-read the problem
2. Try a smaller example
3. Think about similar problems
4. Consider brute force first
5. Ask for a hint (it's okay!)
6. Try different data structures

## Complexity Discussion Template

> "This solution runs in O(___) time because ___.
> The space complexity is O(___) because we're using ___.
> We could potentially optimize by ___."

## After Solving

- Ask about alternative approaches
- Discuss follow-up questions
- Show interest in the role/team
- Ask thoughtful questions
